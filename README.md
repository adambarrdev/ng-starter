# ng-starter

...a basic angular v1.* starter template.

### Basic Info

Libraries used in this template include:

- jQuery
- bootstrap
- font-awesome
- angular
- angular-ui-bootstrap
- angular-ui-router

### A Few Notes

- All libraries are referenced via cdn because... why not?
- I intentionally didn't include any environment or IDE specific 
    content/configuration as I regularly switch between Visual Studio, 
    VSCode, Brackets, etc.
